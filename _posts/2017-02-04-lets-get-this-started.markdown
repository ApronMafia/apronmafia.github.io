The first I started Keto was January 1, 2016. I needed a change, I was tired of
feeling like a fat, unhealthy role model for my two girls, and I had a boy on
the way as well. I'd tried many different diets over the years, as I've been
overweight as long as I can remember. None of them really worked for me. I was
always hungry, the food tasted terrible, and I just couldn't keep with it for
long.

One day, probably around October 2015, I was browsing around
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), hit the [/r/loseit](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit)
subreddit, then found [/r/keto](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto) through there.
The idea that I could eat bacon, eggs, steak, chicken, butter, etc., have more
consistent energy levels, stop the pain in my joints and back, and a bunch of
other health benefits including losing weight, I was hooked.

I started reading more of the science, and it's certainly easier to find studies
supporting a low-carb, high-fat lifestyle than any that prove that low-fat diets
are healthier. Either it's confirmation bias, or those studies just don't really
exist.

I ate the Keto diet from Jan 1 until around mid-late April, when my son was born.
In that time period, I lost 47 lbs, gained a lot of confidence, had a clearer
head, my attitude had improved, and I got stronger. I was lifting weights with
friends, running 3-6 miles at a time (never thought that would happen!), and
bike rides became incredibly relaxing. My blood test results got better, blood
pressure dropped to normal levels, skin cleared up, and again, just lots of
benefits.

Unfortunately, I let myself slip after the baby was born, as it was "easier" to
not think about what I was eating. I gained back most of the weight, and stopped
working out or running. I wasn't sleeping as well, stress was getting to me more,
and I just felt less happy.

Ultimately, I've started Keto again on January 1, 2017. I already feel benefits
from it, and I haven't even started the exercise portion of it yet. I've also
got a couple friends interested in it, and they will also be writing about their
exeperiences. Hopefully, others will read what we're doing, and come to the
conclusion themselves that it's time to try Keto.
